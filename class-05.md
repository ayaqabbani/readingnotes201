# Images
adding images in an html page is a great option you might wanna include a logo, photograph, 
illustration, diagram, or chart in your page.
before you add an image you should pick it and it should be related to the article that you are writing or the page that you are making.

### size
next you should make sure that its in the perfect size to match your page (not too big, not to small) depending on your page elements.

### format
you also need to pay attention to the image format it may be in PNG/GIF/JFIF..., but the best format to save the picture in is JPEG for photographs, and GIF for logos and illustrations that use flat colors.

### How?
 now for the element you should use is the magical < img> element, but it wont work alone !, you must specify a src attribute that brings the source of our targeted image, and next we have the alt attribute that describes the content of the image and it should be meaningful for example you cant attatch a cat image and describe it as a flower !.

# colors
Black and white pages really look dull and boring with Colors you'll really bring your page to life.
you can either add it to your background or your fonts and elements.

## Understanding Color
Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. 
for colors picking you can use a color picker or the css will recommend you some basic colors to choose from.
Computer monitors are made up of thousands of tiny squares called pixels,The color of every pixel on the screen is expressed in terms of a mix of red, green, and blue.
When the screen is not turned on, it's black because it's not emitting any light.
and there are three ways to specify colors in CSS:

* RGB Values
Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255.

* Hex Codes
Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code.

* Color Names
Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number.

but you should pay attention to the contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).

# text 
The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups:

* Those that directly affect the font and its appearance (including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic, and the size of the text).

* Those that would have the same effect on text no matter what font you were using (including the color of text and the spacing between words and letters).

## Typeface Terminology
there are many typefaces and if you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.

* Serif: Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters.

* Sans-Serif: Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design.

* Monospace: Every letter in a monospace (or fixed-width) font is the same width.

* weight: The font weight not only adds emphasis but can also affect the amount of white space and contrast on a page.

* style: Italic fonts have a cursive aspect to some of the lettering, Oblique font styles take the normal style and put it on an angle.

* stretch: In condensed (or narrow) versions of the font, letters are thinner and closer together. 

- When choosing a typeface, it is important to understand that a browser will usually only display it if it's installed on that user's computer, and you may have You noticed that programs such as Word, Photoshop and InDesign offer the same sizes of text.

- You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented, You can also use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
