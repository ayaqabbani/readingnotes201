# Tables 
There are several types of information that need to be displayed in a grid or table. For example: sports results, stock reports, train timetables.
A table represents information in a grid format, examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sports results.
the table consist rows headings and colomns
how can we make tables?
The < table> element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.
A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the < tr> element.
Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the < td> element (or < th> if it is a (header).
You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.

# functions,methods and objects
constructor notation
the new keyword and the object constructor creats a blank object which you can add properties and methods to.
to update the value of properties, use dot notation or square brackets, they work on them using literal or constructor notaion, and to delete a property you can use the delete keyword.
but some times you'll need several objects to represent similar things , the object constructors can use a function as template for creating objects first, create the template with the object's properties and methods.\then you create instances of the object using the constructor function.
the new keyword followed by a call to the function creates a new object. 
the properties of each object are given as arguments to the function.
## arrays are objects 
arrays are actually a special type of object, they hold a related set of key or value pairs, but the key for each value is its index number.
