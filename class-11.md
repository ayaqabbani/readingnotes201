# images
as we know css allows us to edit images after adding them in many ways, we can minipulate these imags by the width height position or even place them as a background if we want to.
# size
You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can  for any other box.
First you need to determine the sizes of images that will be used commonly throughout the site, then give each size a name.
Where the < img> elements appear in the HTML, rather than using width and height attributes you can use these names as values for the class attribute. 

# alignment 
Rather than using the < img> element's align attribute, web page authors are increasingly using the float property to align images. There are two ways that this is commonly achieved:
1. The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image.

2. New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images to the left or right of the page.
These class names are used in addition to classes that indicate the size of the image.

or you just can sipmly center it, By default, images are inline elements.
This means that they flow within the surrounding text. In order to center an image, it should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display property with a value of block. 
there are two common ways in which you can horizontally center an image:
1. On the containing element, you can use the text-align property with a value of center.
2. On the image itself, you can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto.

# background
CSS3 supports the use of multiple background images by repeating the background shorthand.
Because few browsers supported this property at the time of writing, it was not commonly used.
The properties must be specified in the following order, but you can miss any value if you do not want to specify it.
1. background-color
2. background-image
3. background-repeat
4. background-attachment
5. background-position

# Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
Search engine optimization (or SEO) is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers.
SEO is often split into two areas: on-page techniques and off-page techniques.
* on-page techniques:
On-page techniques are the 
methods you can use on your web pages to improve their rating in search engines.The main component of this is looking at keywords that people are likely to enter into a search engine if they wanted to find  your site, and then including these in the text and HTML code for your site in order to help the search engines know that your site covers these topics.
* off-page technique:
Getting other sites to link to you is just as important as on-page techniques. 
Search engines help determine how to rank your site by looking at the number of other sites that link to yours, They are particularly interested in sites whose content is related to yours.

# On-Page SEO
In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords can appear in order 
to improve its findability:
1. Page title.
2. URL/web address.
3. Headings.
4. Text.
5. Link text.
6. Image alt text.
7. Page descriptions.

* Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to see how many people visit your site, how they find it, and what they do when they get there.
