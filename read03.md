# lists
 HTML provides us with three different types of lists:
 1. ordered lists: 
 each item in this list is provided by a nymber.
 2. unordered list: 
 these listed items starts with a bullet point.
 3. Definition lists: 
 they are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
 
 the funny thing about them is that these lists can be nested inside one another.

 # boxes
 CSS treats each HTML element as if it lives in its own box, you can control and style this boxes with whatever you want, colors, borders or even set margin.

 ## borders, margin & padding 
 Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:
 * border (visible or hidden)
 * margin (outside the edge of the border)
 * padding (the space between the border and the box)
  
  not forgetting the importance of margin and padding for the white spaces, The padding and margin properties are very helpful in adding space between various items on the page, they add more appealing look for the elements.

  as for styling the borders there are plenty of styling elements you can control how they look such as dotting,
  adding colors or even CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders, isn't that cool!.

# basic JavaScript instructions
and you start by declaring variables, variables are like a container to a hold value and its s a good name for this concept because the data stored in a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs or as required . first you need to declare it by creating it and give it a name, and then assign it a value by adding this value after the equal sign, and now you have it all in ! .

and theres another kind that is called Arrays. Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.

as for the data that can be stored inside it there are four kinds,numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). and the expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

# decisions & loops
## switch statements
A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value, Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value. 

to compare the switch to the if statement There is no need to provide an else option in the if You can just use an if statement but in switch You have a default option that is run if none of the cases match.
the if performs more slowly than switch because of the series of if statements, they are all checked even if a match has been found but in switch You have a default option that is run if one of the cases match.

## loops
loops check a condition, if it returns true it'll run and will keep checking to see if it still true, untill it returns as false.
there are three common types of loops:
* for : to run code a specific numer of times and it uses a counter to tell how many times the loop should run.
* while : this loop will run endlessly if the condition returns as false, untill its its true then it'll stop running.
* do while : its like the while loop exept that even if the condition evaluates to false it'll run at least once inside the curly braces.
